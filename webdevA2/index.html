                <h1 class="title">What is Sport Stacking</h1>
                <p>Sport stacking, also known as cup stacking or speed stacking, is an individual and team sport that
                    involves stacking 9 to 12 specially designed cups in predetermined sequences as quickly as possible.
                    The
                    cups are specially designed with holes to allow for air to pass through. Participants of sport
                    stacking
                    stack cups in specific sequences by aligning the inside left lateral adjunct of each cup with that
                    of
                    the next. Sequences are usually pyramids of 3, 6, or 10 cups. Players compete against the clock or
                    another player.</p>

                <p>Official sport stacking cups are specially designed to prevent sticking and to allow the competitor
                    to go faster. The cups are reinforced with several ribs on the inside which separate the cups when
                    they are nestled. The exterior is slightly textured to allow better grip. The insides are very
                    smooth and slide past each other easily. The tops of the cups have 1 to 4 holes to allow ventilation
                    so
                    the cups do not stick. One special line of cups has cups without tops to further decrease air
                    resistance.</p>

                <p>StackMat timers are used for official tournament timing, as well as casual play timing or practice
                    timing.</p>

                <p>Special weighted training cups, called "Super Stacks," are made from metal and are most commonly
                    used directly before competing. The added weight is intended to make the regular cups feel
                    lighter.</p>

                <p>Jumbo Stacks are a bigger version of the original speed stacks cups. They are used more commonly in
                    P.E. classes rather than at home.</p>

                <p>There are three sequences stacked in official sport stacking events, that are defined by the rule
                    book handed out by the WSSA:[14]</p>

                <p>- 3–3–3: Uses nine cups. This sequence consists of three sets of three cups each. The three sets must
                    be stacked going from left-to-right or right-to-left, and then down-stacked into their original
                    positions in the same order as the up-stack.</p>
                <p>- 3–6–3: Uses 12 cups. This sequence is similar to the 3–3–3, except a six stack replaces the three
                    stack in the middle. Each pile of cups is stacked up from left-to-right or right-to-left, and the
                    down-stack occurs in the same order.</p>
                <p>- Cycle: Uses 12 cups. This sequence involves a 3–6–3 which is then down-stacked and then going into
                    a
                    6–6 stack which is down-stacked again and finally stacked into a 1–10–1 and all down-stacked back
                    into how it started.</p>
